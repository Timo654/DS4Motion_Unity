# GyroController_Unity
This project is a fork of DS4Motion_Unity, that I updated for a personal project to add DualSense support. It doesn't implement any of the other features, only gyro and accelerometer.

It gets motion data from the controller using Unity's new Input System.

Feel free to use this, or make pull requests to improve it - it's possible that something's completely wrong as I didn't really have any idea what I was doing.


## Supported controllers
+ DualShock 4 (USB only)
+ DualSense (USB only)

## Note
+ The new Input System requires Unity 2019.1 or later.  
+ This project is using Unity 2022.3.8f1, but it'll probably work on older/newer versions too.
